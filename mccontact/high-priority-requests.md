# High priority requests

To request the production of Monte Carlo samples centrally, PdmV has introduced the [JIRA](https://its.cern.ch/jira/projects/HIGHPRIOREQ) ticket to request the high priority samples, where the Monte Carlo contact person has to include the following points in the JIRA ticket:

* **No. of events, Ticket of McM  (in case that it needs approval)**
* **Link to requests (in case that samples are already injected)**
* **CADI line**
* **Target time for completion (target conference, or CWR, publication)**

Please note that the PAG conveners should be tagged in the ticket (or as watcher). The general flow chart of the JIRA tickets is as follows:&#x20;
