# How to find the cmsDriver used for a certain request

If one wants to get information about the cmsDriver of a request, the easiest way is to go to the request page (example: [PPD-PhaseIIMTDTDRAutumn18GS-00032](https://cms-pdmv.cern.ch/mcm/requests?prepid=PPD-PhaseIIMTDTDRAutumn18GS-00032\&page=0)) and click the "get\_test" button:

A text file will appear which contains the list of commands to setup the environment and the full cmsDriver used for that request.
