# McM glossary: chained requests

### What is a chained request?

A chained request is a collection of requests which connects different steps of the production. Submission of a chained request happens within the task chain/step chain settings and gives generally an output dataset for each step of the chain.

### Approval:

Not used in production. Generally is "flow".

### Status:

Can be "done" if request is completed, "submitted" if request is submitted, or "new" if request is not submitted.

### Last status

It reflects the last status of the requests which are chained (see status of requests for the meaning).

### Chain:

In the chain, all the requests of the chain (and their order in it) is shown.

### Step:

It indicates what is the currently processing request in the chain (shown with a star in the "chain", next to the request which is being processed by the system)
